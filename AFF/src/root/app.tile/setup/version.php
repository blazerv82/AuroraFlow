    We'd recommend the latest possible version of AFF, to avoid any coding issues, 
    as well as being able to use the most latest features.
    <?php echo $content[0]; ?> is the latest version, featuring a revamped Tiles engine,
    along with many fixes and additions.

    Currently, downloads of the latest version are the only thing you can get. 
    In time, it's planned to add some of the older versions, although those wont be anywhere
    near complete or even functional for many websites.
