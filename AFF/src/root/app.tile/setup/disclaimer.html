    AuroraFlow uses Normalize.CSS to reset several parts of a webpage, to ensure
    consitent styling and a baseline for the custom styling AuroraFlow provides. 
    That said,
    <span class="inline-code-container">div</span>
    and
    <span class="inline-code-container">span</span>
    tags are the only tag fully supported with styling/sizing.
    <span class="inline-code-container">p</span>
    and
    <span class="inline-code-container">pre</span>
    tags are supported for the
    <span class="inline-code-container">text-container</span> 
    element. Use other tags with caution, as not all combinations of elements and classes work.

    Also of note is that AFF is designed for the modern browser. If your browser supports
    <span class="inline-code-container">flexbox</span>
    and modern JS features, then more than likely you're all set to start using AFF!
