    We'd recommend the latest possible version of AFF, to avoid any coding issues, as well as being able to use the most latest features.
    Currently 8.0 is the latest, its biggest change being the addition of the BricksNBlocks framework, a small(er) project added to AFF that allows for basic
    templating, something this (and other) pages are built with.

    Currently, downloads of the latest version are the only thing you can get. In time, it's planned to add some of the older versions, although those wont be anywhere
    near complete or even functional for production websites.
